# PhaserExample
This is a simple game made with the Phaser (http://phaser.io/) HTMlL5 framework for the CarlHacks (http://carlhacks.io/) 2015 Hackathon. For a barebones copy of a Phaser project, see: [here](https://github.com/OmarShehata/BasicPhaser)

## Getting Started

Just double click on the server bat file (or type in the command if you're a non-windows user) to start up the server. You can then access the game through: 127.0.0.1:8000 

Make sure you have Python installed!
